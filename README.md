# Border_Gavaskar_Trophy_2020_Analysis_Using_Power_BI

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2020 was a highly significant Test cricket series played between India and Australia. It consisted of four Test matches and was notable for several reasons:

##### Australia's Victory in the First Test:
The series began with the Adelaide Test, where Australia secured a dominant eight-wicket victory over India. India was bowled out for just 36 runs in their second innings, which marked their lowest-ever total in Test cricket.

##### India's Comeback in the Second Test: 
Despite the heavy defeat in the first Test, India made a stunning comeback in the second Test, which took place in Melbourne. Led by stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane, India won by eight wickets. This victory was particularly impressive as India was without their regular captain Virat Kohli, who was on paternity leave.

##### Injury Challenges for India: 
Throughout the series, India faced significant injury challenges, with many key players, including Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravindra Jadeja, getting injured at various points. Despite these setbacks, India managed to field competitive teams.

##### India's Historic Win in Brisbane: 
The most remarkable moment of the series was India's historic victory in the fourth and final Test held at the Gabba in Brisbane. Chasing a target of 328 runs, India achieved the target with three wickets remaining, thus securing an unlikely victory and winning the series 2-1. This was India's first Test series win in Australia since the inception of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
